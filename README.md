Upon locating the source table, the script will verify its presence in the destination database.
Table Creation in Destination:
If the table does not exist in the destination, it will be created to facilitate data synchronization.
Data Synchronization Approach:
Data synchronization will be performed in batches of 5000 records using bulk operations.
